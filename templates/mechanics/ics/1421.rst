Clock [MC1421]
==============

**Clocks**, well are a simpler way of using a minecraft timer that does not requires much buiding but instead requires only a sign and a block.

You only need three lines:

    1. Leave first line blank

    2. Type on 2nd line: [MC1421] Side-note: Do [MC1421]S to make it Self-triggered and give it a redstone signal to stop it 

    3. And on the third line type the amount of 2 ticks the clock should take for it to give an output! 
    
The images below shoud be what you get:

When the timer reaches the desired time for it to give out and output:

.. image:: /images/ics/clock_on.png
    :align: center
    
And when it is not the desired time

.. image:: /images/ics/clock_off.png
    :align: center
    
Please note that behind the block with the sign should be a lever connected to the redstone
