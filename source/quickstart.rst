Enabling Mechanics
==================

All of CraftBook's features are disabled by default. This is to allow server owners the ability to customise CraftBook to do exactly what they want it to do.

CraftBook's features are broken up into sections called **Mechanics**.

You can enable or disable mechanics in the ``config.yml`` file (see :doc:`config`).

* Decide what you want to enable. Check out :doc:`mechanics/index` for information on each Mechanic.
* Set anything you want to enable to ``true``, under the ``mechanics`` section of the config.

Configuring Mechanics
=====================

Many mechanics can be further configured. For more information on specific configuration options, check out that mechanic's page found :doc:`here <mechanics/index>`.

To configure these mechanics, find the ``CraftBook/mechanics`` folder. In this folder, you'll find the configuration files for each mechanic.

Using Mechanics
===============

As each mechanic is used differently, the best point of reference is that mechanic's page found :doc:`here <mechanics/index>`.
