======================
Minecart Strong Braker
======================

The **Minecart Strong Braker** mechanic causes a minecart to strongly brake when it travels over the configured block.

This mechanic reduces the speed by 50%.

Redstone Activation
===================

Brakers can be turned on and off with redstone. If no redstone wire is connected, it'll activate.
However, when redstone is connected to either the rail block, the mechanic block, or the sign, an on signal is required for the braker to activate.
