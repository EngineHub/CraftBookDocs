=====================
Minecart Light Braker
=====================

The **Minecart Light Braker** mechanic causes a minecart to lightly brake when it travels over the configured block.

This mechanic reduces the speed by 20%.

Redstone Activation
===================

Brakers can be turned on and off with redstone. If no redstone wire is connected, it'll activate.
However, when redstone is connected to either the rail block, the mechanic block, or the sign, an on signal is required for the braker to activate.
