====================
Minecart Max Booster
====================

The **Minecart Max Booster** mechanic causes a minecart to accelerate to max speed when it travels over the configured block.

Redstone Activation
===================

Boosters can be turned on and off with redstone. If no redstone wire is connected, it'll activate.
However, when redstone is connected to either the rail block, the mechanic block, or the sign, an on signal is required for the booster to activate.
