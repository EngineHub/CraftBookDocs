Minecart Booster
================

The **Minecart Booster** mechanic causes a minecart to receive a speed boost when it travels over the configured block.

This mechanic provides a 25% speed boost to minecarts.

Redstone Activation
===================

Boosters can be turned on and off with redstone. If no redstone wire is connected, it'll activate.
However, when redstone is connected to either the rail block, the mechanic block, or the sign, an on signal is required for the booster to activate.
