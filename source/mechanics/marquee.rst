Marquee
=======

The **Marquee** mechanic outputs the contents of a variable to the player that right clicks the sign.

Construction
============

To construct a marquee sign, simply put [Marquee] on the second line of a sign.

On the 3rd line of the sign you must enter the name of the variable you wish to display, without any %'s.

If you wish to use a namespace other than the default, you must also put the namespace on the 4th line.

For example, if you wished to display the variable `carpet` in the `carrot` namespace, You'd enter `carpet` on the 3rd line, and `carrot` on the 4th.
