MC1219
======

The MC1219 crafts the recipe laid out in the above dispenser/dropper on powered, then spits it out of the dispenser/dropper (Note: Dropper is recommended, as not all items can be dispensed from a dispenser, eg bonemeal).

It only crafts when there is more than 1 in each slot, so it will always have the template to go by. It also will automatically put stacks into the dispenser that are touching the sign on input going high.

Note: Recipes need to be docked against top left corner.
