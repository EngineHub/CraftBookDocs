======
MC1111
======

The '''MC1111''' receives the state in a particular ''band'' or ''network'' when the clock input goes from low to high.
The corresponding transmitter is the [[../MC1110/]] IC.

If there are multiple transmitters for the same band, the last one to transmit to a particular band will have its state apply until the next transmission.
