Snow
====

The **Snow** mechanic adds a few new features to the snow block, and weather in snowy regions.

Features
========

Piling
------

The main feature of the Snow mechanic is the addition of snow piling. Snow piling allows snow to pile up higher than a single layer, causing snow to create more of a gameplay obstacle.

By default, snow will only pile up to the point where it is a single block tall.

High Piling
~~~~~~~~~~~

High piling allows the snow piles to keep piling up beyond one block tall. This number can still be limited in the configuration to prevent crazy high snow piles.

Trampling
---------

The trampling feature allows the player to trample snow by walking over it, causing it to slowly lower in height.

Jump Trampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Jump trampling is a modified version of the trample feature, that requires the player to be jumping or landing on the snow. This behaves similarly to crop trampling.

Partial Trampling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Partial trampling adds a further restriction to what snow can be trampled, by not allowing the bottom layer of snow to be trampled. This means that trampling snow will not get rid of the vanilla Minecraft layer of snow.

Slowdown
--------

The slowdown feature causes the player to receive a temporary slowness effect when they walk through piles of snow. This effect becomes stronger when the snow is deeper.

Snowball Placement
------------------

The snowball placement feature allows snowballs to create snow where they land.

.. note::

    Due to poor ray tracing accuracy of the Minecraft server, the snow may not always appear exactly where you expect it to.

Melt
----

The melt feature causes snow to melt in warmer areas when it's not snowing.

Partial Melt
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Partial melt adds a further restriction to what snow can melt, similar to Partial Trampling. This prevents the bottom layer of the snow from melting, allowing piled snow to slowly disappear after snowfall has ended.

.. note::

    This is most similar to vanilla Minecraft behaviour, and retains a layer of snow on mountains and snowy terrain. All snow will still melt in hot climates such as deserts or jungles.

Dispersion
----------

Dispersion is the most complex and interesting feature of the Snow mechanic. This feature adds realistic snow physics simulation to the game, causing snow to flow down mountains similar to how it would behave in real life.

Snow with dispersion enabled allows for events such as:

* Houses being snowed in
* Snow flowing into the mouths of caves
* Avalanches

.. note::

    Due to the large number of block changes this produces, it's not recommended for use on high-traffic servers. This feature may also cause performance issues when the duration of snowfall has been modified beyond vanilla values.
