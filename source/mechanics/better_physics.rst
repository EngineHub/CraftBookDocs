Better Physics
==============

The **Better Physics** mechanic is a series of features that aim to enhance "physics" interactions in the game to add more dynamic gameplay.

Falling Ladders
===============

Falling ladders causes ladders to fall down when not supported by a block. This allows for a player to drop ropes down a drop, and break the ladders once they reach the bottom.
