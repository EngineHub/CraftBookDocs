Requirements
============

CraftBook requires a version of the Minecraft server that supports the `Bukkit API <https://spigotmc.org/>`_, which includes `PaperMC <https://papermc.io>`_ and Spigot. The official Minecraft server is not supported.

.. note::

     Newer versions of CraftBook are available that support the `Sponge API <https://spongepowered.org/>`_, they can be found `here <https://ore.spongepowered.org/enginehub/CraftBook/>`_.

Installation
============

CraftBook can be `downloaded from the EngineHub site <http://builds.enginehub.org/job/craftbook/>`_.

1. If you downloaded CraftBook as a ZIP file, extract it to find "CraftBook.jar" inside. Otherwise, you should already have a .jar file.
2. In your server folder, create a "plugins" folder if one does not yet exist.
3. Copy the CraftBook .jar file into the plugins folder.
4. Start your server.

Note: CraftBook requires that WorldEdit is installed.

Check your server log for errors. If you encounter errors, see the :doc:`support` page.
