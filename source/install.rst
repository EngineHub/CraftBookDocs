Requirements
============

CraftBook runs on the Java edition of Minecraft, on a dedicated server.

**CraftBook canâ€™t be used on Realms, Windows 10, Bedrock, or Pocket Edition versions.** These versions of Minecraft have limited or no mod support. :(

Before you install CraftBook, you will first have to have a server that supports Paper plugins, such as Paper or one of its forks.

While you can use forks of Paper, we strongly recommend using `Paper itself <https://papermc.io/>`_ as many forks are known to be unstable and break plugins. See `here <https://madelinemiller.dev/blog/using-paper-forks/>`_ for further reasons to use Paper over its forks.

.. note::

     A now discontinued version of CraftBook is available that supports the `Sponge API <https://spongepowered.org/>`_, it can be found `here <https://ore.spongepowered.org/enginehub/CraftBook/>`_.

Installation
============

CraftBook 5 can be `downloaded from the EngineHub Builds site <https://builds.enginehub.org/job/craftbook?branch=five>`_.

.. note::

    In the future, CraftBook 5 will be downloadable from Hangar, Paper's in-development plugin repository.

1. In your server folder, create a "plugins" folder if one does not yet exist.
2. Copy the CraftBook .jar file into the plugins folder. (Make sure you get WorldEdit as well!)
3. Start your server.

Check your server log for errors. If you encounter errors, see the :doc:`support` page.
