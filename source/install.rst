Requirements
============

CraftBook runs on the Java edition of Minecraft, on a dedicated server.

**CraftBook canâ€™t be used on Realms, Windows 10, Bedrock, or Pocket Edition versions.** These versions of Minecraft have limited or no mod support. :(

Before you install CraftBook, you will first have to have a server that supports Bukkit plugins, such as Paper or Spigot.

While you can use either, we strongly recommend using `Paper <https://papermc.io/>`_ as it allows CraftBook to work better and also perform better. See `here <https://matthewmiller.dev/blog/paper-vs-spigot/>`_ for further reasons to use Paper over Spigot.

.. note::

     A now discontinued version of CraftBook is available that supports the `Sponge API <https://spongepowered.org/>`_, it can be found `here <https://ore.spongepowered.org/enginehub/CraftBook/>`_.

Installation
============

CraftBook can be `downloaded from the BukkitDev site <http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/craftbook/>`_.

1. In your server folder, create a "plugins" folder if one does not yet exist.
2. Copy the CraftBook .jar file into the plugins folder. (Make sure you get WorldEdit as well!)
3. Start your server.

Check your server log for errors. If you encounter errors, see the :doc:`support` page.
