CraftBook Documentation
=======================

CraftBook is an easy-to-use plugin that adds hundreds of optional and customisable gameplay additions to your server. Through a combination of mechanics, you can give your server a unique gameplay style.

* Modular, and extremely light on your server. **Everything is off by default.**
* Enable features that you need, disable ones that you don't. Even tweak features to your liking.
* Elevators for your server so people can jump between floors quickly.
* Chairs you can sit on.
* Redstone-controlled schematics, bridges, gates, and doors.
* Hidden switches to create hidden passageways.
* Working pipes that can transfer items from place to place.
* Working cauldron brewing with a custom recipe creator.
* Create your own crafting and smelting recipes.
* Head drops for players and almost every mob.
* Bind commands to items, with cooldowns, permissions and timers to create custom items.
* Advanced Redstone ICs (Logic gates, Sensors, :doc:`And many more <mechanics/ics/index>`)
* Realistic snow dispersion and enhanced snow mechanics.
* Overhauled minecart systems.
* Many features that inspired mods in FeedTheBeast, all without needing a client mod.
* `Open source <https://github.com/EngineHub/CraftBook>`_, and one of the oldest Minecraft projects (since Minecraft Alpha!)
