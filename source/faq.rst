Why don't any commands work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If no commands work, it may be because CraftBook failed to start:

* Make sure that you are running Paper (or a server software that supports Paper plugins). Use the ``version`` command in console or in-game and make sure that the response has "Paper" in it.
* Make sure that you have `WorldEdit <https://enginehub.org/worldedit/>`_ installed.
* Make sure that you have the proper version of CraftBook for your version of Minecraft.

If those solutions do not help you, you will need to look through your startup log:

* If you use a game server host, use its log viewer.
* You can also open up "latest.log" in the logs folder of your server directory.

If you are unable to discover the problem from reading the server log, you can :doc:`ask for help or submit a bug report <support>`.

Some feature isn't working!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a feature isn't working, make sure that it's enabled in the CraftBook configuration. By default, CraftBook will do nothing.

How old is CraftBook?
