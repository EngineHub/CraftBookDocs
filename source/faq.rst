Why don't any commands work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If no commands work, it may because CraftBook failed to start:

* Make sure that you are running Sponge (or a server software that supports SpongeAPI). Use the ``sponge`` command in console or in-game and make sure that the command exists.
* Make sure that, if you had downloaded CraftBook as a ZIP file, that you have extracted CraftBook.
* Make sure that you have the proper version of CraftBook for your version of Minecraft.

If those solutions do not help you, you will need to look through your startup log:

* If you use a game server host, use its log viewer.
* You can also open up "latest.log" in the logs folder of your server directory. (On older versions of Minecraft, the log file was "server.log" in the root directory.)

If you are unable to discover the problem from reading the server log, you can :doc:`ask for help or submit a bug report <../support>`.

How old is CraftBook?
