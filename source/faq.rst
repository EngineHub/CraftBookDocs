Why don't any commands work?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If no commands work, it may because CraftBook failed to start:

* Make sure that you are running Bukkit (or a server software that supports Bukkit). Use the ``version`` command in console or in-game and make sure that the response has "Bukkit" or "CraftBukkit" in it.
* Make sure that you have `WorldEdit <http://www.enginehub.org/worldedit>`_ installed.
* Make sure that you have the proper version of CraftBook for your version of Minecraft.

If those solutions do not help you, you will need to look through your startup log:

* If you use a game server host, use its log viewer.
* You can also open up "latest.log" in the logs folder of your server directory. (On older versions of Minecraft, the log file was "server.log" in the root directory.)

If you are unable to discover the problem from reading the server log, you can :doc:`ask for help or submit a bug report <support>`.

Some feature isn't working!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If a feature isn't working, make sure that it's enabled in the CraftBook configuration. By default, CraftBook will do nothing.

How old is CraftBook?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

CraftBook began in November 2010 for the "hMod" modding platform by `sk89q <http://www.sk89q.com>`_. Later on, CraftBook was ported to Bukkit, and
later Sponge. `Me4502 <https://madelinemiller.dev/>`_ has been the lead developer since April 2012.
